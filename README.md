# PCOS-Identification-Using-Machine-Learning

This project is written in Python using Google Colab. It employs back elimination to remove unnecessary features from the dataset and then proceeds to use SVM to train the model.

## Installation
When installing this onto your device be aware that you need both the python file and the dataset. Please install both.

## Usage
After installation, preferably use Google Collab to execute the code. There should be a pop-up inside the code that asks for you to select the file you want to use for the dataset. Click this and select the dataset file you have downloaded. After that, the project should be executable.

## Screenshots
